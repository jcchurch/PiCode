"""

Suppose we create a 2 unit by 2 unit square.

Suppose we drop that square's center on the origin point
of a Cartesian graph.

The area of this square is 4.

Suppose we then create a 1 unit radius circle and drop
the circle's center on the origin point of a Cartesian
graph.

The area of the circle is pi * 1 * 1 (or pi).

If we drop a random dot somewhere on the square, the
probability that it will land on the circle is pi/4.

If we drop MANY random dots on the square, then we
can predict that (n * pi) / 4 dots will also be in
the circle.

in_circle = (n * pi) / 4

If we solve for pi, then we get this:

pi = (in_circle * 4) / n

As n approaches infinity, pi will equal 3.14159.
